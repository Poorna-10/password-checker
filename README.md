# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A web-based application that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords based on multiple criteria. This project uses **Python**, **Flask**, and **HTML/CSS**, and is deployable to **Render Cloud**.

## 🌐 Live Demo
> [Add your Render URL here once deployed]

---

## 📌 Features

- Evaluates password strength: Weak, Moderate, Strong
- Checks for:
  - Minimum length (8+ characters)
  - Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Presence of digits
  - Special characters (`!@#$%^&*...`)
  - Avoidance of common patterns (`123`, `password`, `qwerty`, etc.)
- User-friendly web interface
- Deployable on cloud platforms like **Render**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-checker.git
cd password-strength-checker

2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Visit: http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

☁️ Deploy on Render
Push your project to GitHub.

Go to https://dashboard.render.com/

Click "New Web Service" > Connect to your GitHub repo.

Set the following:

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: gunicorn app:app

Environment: Python 3.11 (or later)

Deploy & access your live app URL.

✅ Password Strength Logic
Criteria	Checked	Points
Length ≥ 8 characters	✅	+1
Contains uppercase letters	✅	+1
Contains lowercase letters	✅	+1
Contains digits	✅	+1
Contains special characters	✅	+1
Avoids common patterns	✅	(no point, warning only)

Strength Levels:
Weak: ≤ 2 points

Moderate: 3 points

Strong: ≥ 4 points

🎯 Future Improvements
Real-time password validation with JavaScript

REST API version for integration into other systems

Password breach checking using HaveIBeenPwned

Docker containerization for portability

CI/CD integration for auto-deployments

## 🔍 How Unique Is This Project?

### ✅ What Makes It Unique

| Feature                              | Status     | Notes |
|--------------------------------------|------------|-------|
| Custom password scoring              | ✔️         | Tailored logic instead of relying on libraries like zxcvbn |
| Web interface with Flask             | ✔️         | Simple and effective web app |
| Cloud deployable (Render)            | ✔️         | Hosted in the cloud, usable from anywhere |
| Common pattern filtering             | ✔️         | Security-focused detail |

### ❗ What’s Common / Can Be Improved

- Similar password checkers exist as online tools or browser plugins.
- Most modern sites use client-side JS or advanced libraries like **zxcvbn**.
- Doesn’t yet check for **data breaches** or provide **entropy analysis**.

## 💡 Suggestions to Make It More Unique

1. **Add HaveIBeenPwned API Check**: Show users if the password has been leaked.
2. **Entropy Calculation**: Use Shannon entropy or similar to show real strength.
3. **Real-Time Validation**: Implement live checking using JavaScript.
4. **REST API**: Offer JSON-based strength evaluation for integration in other apps.
5. **Gamify Feedback**: Show progress bars, emoji indicators, or tips.
6. **Accessibility Support**: Make sure it works with screen readers.
